<h3 id="working-with-allele-frequency-studies">Working with allele frequency studies</h3>

<p>This tool allows you to convert allele frequency study data between a wide variety of formats. Currently supported formats are <strong>leapdna, Familias, relMix, LRMixStudio</strong> and <strong>EuroForMix</strong>. All of these can be used as both input and output to the tool.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft Excel is not a supported format. If you wish to convert files from Microsoft Excel to one of the supported formats you need to export them as CSV first, making sure that only the allele matrix is included in the generated CSV file.

<ol>
  <li>To begin, click the <em>Choose fileâ€¦</em> button on the left and select a file from your computer that contains allele frequency data.</li>
  <li>leapdna will make an attempt to guess the format of the file automatically. If this succeeds, you will be presented with a preview of the allele-locus matrix here. If it fails, you may need to tune the input parameters.</li>
  <li>You can also apply some transformations to the input you provided, such as normalizing the allele frequencies so that they sum up to one or adding a <em>rare</em> allele which accounts for the remaining frequency needed so that allele frequencies sum up to one.</li>
  <li>When you are happy with the results you can download the data using the Save button.</li>
