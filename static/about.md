## About the leapdna project

During the last decade, forensic case-workers have benefited from many open-source projects which help them perform the calculations required to put the results of a DNA test in context and present them before a jury. Over time, the statistical models have become more advanced and now handle additional datapoints such as capillary electrophoresis peak heights, arbitrarily complex pedigrees and advanced mutation models. In addition, advances in analysis techniques such as the introduction of DNA sequencing into the STR world provide even more data which must be analysed. Finally, because of the legal context in which this field is evolving, results must be reproducible and shareable between laboratories and researchers, and methods must remain open and backwards-compatible with existing analyses and data.

leapdna aims to address this last requirement by standarising the way data is stored and shared. Starting with allelic frequency population studies, leapdna provides a standarised file format able to handle tranditional length-based allele denominations and with support for many of the different naming conventions which are being discussed for sequence data. To encourage adoption, together with this file format standard we are developing tools to integrate it into the daily workflow of researchers and case-workers alike.
