## About

Leapdna's mission is to facilitate the statistical evaluation of the forensic DNA test. Nowadays, lot of open- and closed-source software is available, each with its particular input and output formats. Sometimes, indiviual programs are not sufficient to carry out all of the analysis involved in one case and one must transfer case data between several of them to get the desired results. Other times, one would like to reuse some carefully prepared data for one program in another but is faced with incompatible input formats between the programs.

Starting with allele frequency data, leapdna is attempting to push a common file format that can be understood by every application. To promote adoption, we provide a comprehensive set of libraries that software authors can use to integrate it into their codebase. For end users, we provide access to a repository of curated allele frequency databases that can be downloaded in a number of formats, including leapdna's own. In addition, we provide (interactive) a tool able to convert between allele frequency database formats in widely used forensic analysis software, including Familias, relMix, LRMixStudio, EuroForMix, the pedsuite and, of course, leapdna's own.
